# DSC-Power-BI-challenge

## Task allocation:

- Main dashboard (Philipp) - happy for others to help with this as I am quite new to Power BI
- Sales Forecast (Alvin)
- Basket Analysis (...)

## To Do

### Main Dashbaord

- Make use of Date Table file (for correct filtering by date?)
- Have Product ID and Product Name (FD: Product ID -> Prodcut Name) in separete dimension table and create one-to-many relationship to Product ID in Orders Table
- Maybe add columns in Orders table with additional info such as cost of product / cost per unit, maybe any other interesting info
- Change colors in region pie chart and category/subcategory bar chart, otherwise people might assume relation between same colours
- Add visual with info on returns in Dashboard
- Add visual with info on customers in Dashboard
- Change that each visual affects all other visuals by clicking on them
- Add panels / slicers on left to control slicing
- ANY SUGGESTIONS / IDEAS welcome, above are just my (Philipp) ideas for the moment
